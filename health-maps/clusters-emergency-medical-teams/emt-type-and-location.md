# EMT Type and location

![](../../.gitbook/assets/health_emt_type_and_location.jpg)

Emergency Medical Teams are quality assured by the WHO. Teams can be Type 1 - Outpatient Emergency Care, Type 2 - Inpatient Surgical Emergency Care, Type 3 - Inpatient Referral Care and additional specialist care. Both the type and location of these teams should be mapped along with where the Emergency medical Team Coordination Cell \(EMT CC\) is located. 

## Strategic or operational? 

Both

## Basemap, baseline or situational?

Situational

## When might it be produced? 

Emergency medical Teams are deployed during an emergency and should be mapped as soon as their location and type is known, maps should be kept up to date throughout the emergency to account for any changes over time.

## Intended audience 

Invariably health is linked to many other vulnerabilities and is impacted by all eleven clusters in the UN system \(sectors of the humanitarian system that help to coordinate a humanitarian response\), in particular:

* Nutrition
* Water, Sanitation and Hygiene \(WASH\)
* Logistics - transport / access

The intended audience includes a variety of actors either directly involved in health, or those supporting health needs:

* Ministry of Health / Department for Health
* National Health Care Providers
* Local Government
* Civil Society / Community Organisations
* Affected communities / population
* National and International health related NGOs
* National Red Cross / International Federation of Red Cross
* World Health Organisation
* Emergency Medical Teams /Emergency Medical Teams Coordination Cell

## Influence on humanitarian decisions 

Will be dependent on if the maps are strategic, operational or both and will vary by intended audience. To be updated based on planned expert interviews.

## Methods

Access to timely and accurate data is essential for a health response. It is important to get the best available data although it may not always be perfect.

Robust information management and governance is essential when accessing, storing and visualising health data. The agreed use of the data must be established and recorded from the outset.

A process of data manipulation may be required to ensure individuals, families or villages can not be identified. A number of methods can be used to achieve this including the suppression of small numbers, aggregation of data to a higher level and minimising the use of other data / detail on a map that could make identification easier. These checks must be in place to ensure patientâ€™s right to privacy and dignity are maintained.
