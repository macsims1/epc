* Natural disasters
* Disease outbreaks

* The determinants of health - the populationâ€™s vulnerability before the incident
* The health system - the national healthcare delivery system and any disruption it is facing
* Profiles of morbidity / mortality - any endemic and emerging disease \(existing and recently appearing disease\) that can be both communicable and non-communicable disease \(infectious and non-infectious\)
* Emergency Medical Teams - any surge capacity being provide to the healthcare system
