Shows the population for the area of interest before the emergency. It may show absolute population numbers per district, or population densities.

## Strategic or operational?

Strategic and operational.

## Basemap, baseline or situational?

Baseline.

## When might it be produced?

As early as possible in the emergency, possibly during the pre-deployment stage, subject to availability of data.

## Intended audience

Everyone.

## Influence on humanitarian decisions

The spatial distribution of the baseline population of the disaster-affected area is of high importance in understanding the potential impact of the disaster. By cross-analysing physical impact indicators \(even just a list of affected districts\) with population figures, first attempts can be made to create a humanitarian profile for the emergency. Visualising the distribution of the population is often also important to create understanding of the complex spatial dimensions of a response, such as access constraints and numbers of people living in different livelihood zones \(e.g. upland versus lowland farming\).

* Initial maps showing relative population density should be produced using whatever data is available, but with the source clearly marked.
* Symbolising population density is ideal for visual interpretation, however labelling with absolute numbers can add value for users.
* While total population figures may be used on the map, it can be useful to add other graphics with generalised data to the map sheet, e.g. a pyramid chart to show age and gender breakdown.

## Data

**National Census** 

Census data from the national statistics office should provide the most accurate picture of the population and include further demographics such as age, gender, number of those in school, etc.

**Other sources** 

It should be established whether this data matches the administrative boundaries dataset in use \(which may be inconsistent due to boundary changes since the last census\).
* Common Operational Datasets \(CODs\) and Fundemental Operational Datasets \(FOD\) Registry
* Humanitarian Data Exchange \(HDX\)

**Gridded population estimates**

These datasets may be useful where locally-derived population figures are not available, or cannot be reconciled to administrative boundaries.
* GRUMP, WorldPop, LandScan datasets, may be useful where locally-derived population figures are not available, or cannot be reconciled to administrative boundaries.
