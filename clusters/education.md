Education is one of the key resources to get back in place following a disaster. It is particularly important for children of school age as it provides a safe and protective environment that helps them get to back to some form of normality. Educational facilities may also be used as evacuation centres or meeting facilities, as building standards tend to be higher at these communal buildings.

## Strategic or operational?

Both.

## Basemap, baseline or situational?

Baseline and situational.

## When might it be produced?

Baseline maps may have been produced during earlier preparedness work, but if not they should be produced as soon as possible. Situational maps should be created as the information comes in. At first this may come from initial damage reports, but will then move on to incorporate information from needs assessments.

## Intended audience

All humanitarian actors involved in education, typically through the education cluster or the Ministry of Education.

## Influence on humanitarian decisions

Damage assessments inform actors which education facilities can continue to be used either for their primary function, education, or for other functions such as meeting or evacuation centres.

## Methods

Some facilities will be for multiple age groups i.e. primary and secondary, and these should labelled as clearly as possible.
