These products show sectoral humanitarian needs and operations in respect of IDP camp coordination and management, and associated sectoral activities. They help inform planning and operation of camps for displaced people, both at local/individual level and across the operational area. They may show camp population figures, infrastructure, hazards or resources. Will often use satellite images for basemap.

## Strategic or operational?

Both.

## Basemap, baseline or situational?

Situational

## When might it be produced?

Maps may be required when IDP camps are being planned or established.

## Intended audience

All humanitarian actors involved in camp management and administration, typically through the camp coordination and camp management cluster.

## Influence on humanitarian decisions

Planning of camp locations is driven by spatial factors including safety and access to resources. Within camps, layout planning is facilitated by detailed camp mapping.

Most importantly, camp coordination and camp management mapping reports frequently changing populations and demographics, status of supplies delivered, unmet needs and who-what-where.

## Methods

For detailed site layout planning, satellite imagery is often the most suitable base map. Google Earth can be a useful tool for rapid mapping of new camps.

## Data

* Topographic mapping and/or satellite imagery or air photos for site identification and selection.
* Data on environmental aspects of potential sites, including water resources.
* For detailed layout planning, site features data will be provided by camp coordination and camp management actors.

## Resources

* Camp coordination and camp management global cluster
* Shelter Minimum Sphere Standards
