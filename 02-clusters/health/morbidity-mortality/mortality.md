Mortality / death can be measured in a number of ways including, crude deaths, crude death rate, case fatality and death to case ratios. Mortality maps will be cause / disease specific and can be broken down by particular demographics / risk factors for the disease such as age and sex. Theses maps show the severity and impact of a specific disease or emergency event.

## Strategic or operational? 

Both

## Basemap, baseline or situational? 

Baseline and Situational

## When might it be produced?

Mortality maps are used to understand the severity and impact of a specific disease / emergency event. These maps should be created as soon as the information is available and continually updated through an emergency, it is particularly important to look at these maps over time to show how a disease is progressing.

## Intended audience 

Invariably health is linked to many other vulnerabilities and is impacted by all eleven clusters in the UN system \(sectors of the humanitarian system that help to coordinate a humanitarian response\), in particular:

* Nutrition
* Water, Sanitation and Hygiene \(WASH\)
* Logistics - transport / access

The intended audience includes a variety of actors either directly involved in health, or those supporting health needs:

* Ministry of Health / Department for Health
* National Health Care Providers
* Local Government
* Civil Society / Community Organisations
* Affected communities / population
* National and International health related NGOs
* National Red Cross / International Federation of Red Cross
* World Health Organisation
* Emergency Medical Teams /Emergency Medical Teams Coordination Cell

## Influence on humanitarian decisions 

Will be dependent on if the maps are strategic, operational or both and will vary by intended audience. To be updated based on planned expert interviews.

## Methods

Access to timely and accurate data is essential for a health response. It is important to get the best available data although it may not always be perfect. Questions should be asked such as:

When was the data collected? What time period does it cover? When will it next be updated? How accurate is the data? Are the figures actual or estimates? Is it a crude number, a crude rate, an adjusted or standardised rate?

Robust information management and governance is essential when accessing, storing and visualising health data. The agreed use of the data must be established and recorded from the outset.

A process of data manipulation may be required to ensure individuals, families or villages can not be identified. A number of methods can be used to achieve this including the suppression of small numbers, aggregation of data to a higher level and minimising the use of other data / detail on a map that could make identification easier. These checks must be in place to ensure patientâ€™s right to privacy and dignity are maintained.

## Data

* Crude deaths - count of deaths
* Crude death rates - % deaths from a specific disease within the general population within a specific time period
* Case fatality rate - % of deaths from a specific disease within a population who have that disease over the course of the disease
* Death to case - count of deaths divided by the number of new cases within a specific time period
