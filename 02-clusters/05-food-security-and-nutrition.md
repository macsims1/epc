Products that focus on sectoral humanitarian needs and operations in respect of food security and nutrition. These help visualise needs and plan and coordinate sectoral responses, and may include data on livelihoods and public health baselines. They may utilise data from technical assessments on nutrition status, e.g. as compiled by the World Food Program’s vulnerability and mapping units. They often incorporate data on emergency feeding and nutrition programme coverage.

## Strategic or operational?

Both.

## Basemap, baseline or situational?

Baseline and situational.

## When might it be produced?

May be produced at any stage of an emergency response, but are likely to be most required and requested once a coordinated sectoral response is under way. Food security and nutrition are often large issues in protracted crises, especially complex emergencies.

## Intended audience

All humanitarian actors involved in the food and nutrition sector response, typically through the food security cluster.

## Influence on humanitarian decisions

Food security and nutrition needs in emergencies are often interwoven with a range of other issues and decision factors. Food and nutrition needs often need to be analysed spatially and then mapped in order to identify at-risk populations. This usually follows on from needs assessments carried out by expert agencies such as the World Food Program.

## Methods

* Identify as early as possible the spatial tagging in use in food security and nutrition needs assessment data collection, to ensure that collected data can be mapped.
* Most reported data will be made up of statistics by district, possibly with a temporal component. Choose appropriate data display methods to communicate trends clearly: infographics may be required.
* Take care with precision around terminology: e.g. Severe Acute Malnutrition \(SAM\) and Global Acute Malnutrition \(GAM\) are not the same thing.

## Data

* Administration boundary and settlement datasets that match the reporting structure \(possibly the government’s\) for reporting situational data.
* Standardised data on food and nutrition needs, from response actors and agencies working through the relevant cluster.
* Cluster or other actors may provide spatially-analysed data on food and nutrition distributions and activities, for response planning and gap analysis.
